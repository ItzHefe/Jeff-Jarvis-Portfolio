# Jeff-Jarvis-Portfolio

## About this project:

1. In this project I created the skeleton of a portfolio page.
2. This page will be continually updated to be used as a foundation to show off my work. 

### The Basics:

* Started by writing out the HTML elements to set the framework for this page.
* I added in the CSS to create designs and colored containers. 

### Acceptance Criteria Acknowledgment 

* Working page to see my previous work 
* Recent Photo of myself
* UI scroll mechanics on the top NAV UI
* Link to deployed first app (and img placeholders for future Apps)
* Responsive design elements
