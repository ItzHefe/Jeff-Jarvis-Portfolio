          <p1> I am a friendly giant from Atlanta who currently works as an account manager and is aspiring to bridge the gap between developers and sales teams! I spend my down time hanging out with my two dogs Mac and Fynn, hanging out with my girlfriend, and gaming. Summer weekends are for the lake and live music!

          <p2> I have spent the last six years working across different sales roles involving technology and relationships. I started with at Gartner the worlds number one IT advisory firm. I works directly with technology vendors and helping them market themselves to IT end user buyers. After Gartner I wanted to move back to my home city of Atlanta and work in the software world. I took a account executive role with a data visualization organization called Izenda. Their software embedded into other softwares and pulled data directly from NoSQL databases to make end user friendly visualizations. This role ended up leading me to my current company called GreenSky. Here I work with home improvement contractors and help them use technology to offer point of sales financing solutions to their clients.
