          <p1> I am a friendly giant from Atlanta who currently works as an account manager and is aspiring to bridge
            the gap between developers and sales teams! I spend my down time hanging out with my two dogs Mac and Fynn,
            hanging out with my girlfriend, and gaming. Summer weekends are for the lake and live music!
          </p1>

          <p2> I have spent the last six years working across different sales roles involving technology and
            relationships. I started with at Gartner the worlds number one IT advisory firm. I worked directly with
            technology vendors and helping them market themselves to IT departments. After Gartner, I wanted to move
            back to my home city of Atlanta and work in the software world. I took an account executive role with a data
            visualization organization called Izenda. Their solution embedded into other applications and pulled data
            directly from NoSQL databases to display user friendly visualizations. This role ended up leading me to my
            current company called GreenSky. I currently work with home improvement contractors and help them use technology
            to offer point of sales financing solutions to their clients.
